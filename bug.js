This error occurs when using the Expo SDK's `Camera` component with certain configurations, particularly when using custom camera styles or attempting to access camera features before the component is fully mounted.  It can manifest as a blank screen where the camera preview should be, or a cryptic error message in the console related to native modules or component rendering.
