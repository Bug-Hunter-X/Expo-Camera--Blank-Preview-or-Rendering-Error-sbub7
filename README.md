# Expo Camera: Blank Preview or Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a rare bug encountered when using the Expo Camera component.  The issue manifests as a blank preview screen where the camera feed should be displayed. This often happens when applying custom styles to the Camera component or when attempting to access camera properties before the component is fully mounted and ready.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the app using Expo Go or a similar method.
4. Observe the blank camera preview.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the `Camera` component is fully mounted and ready before attempting to access its properties or perform actions.  Appropriate asynchronous loading or conditional rendering based on component state can prevent this error.
